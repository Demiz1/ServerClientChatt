# ServerClientChatt
A very simple chattserver with client.

This is probably one of my first projects where I used sockets. At the timeI also remember that threads was a fairly new for me. I remember that I had built simple demos with threads but sockets was somethign entierly new. 

This project gave me a very good base understanding of sockets for the [phone-gyro-controlled car](https://github.com/Demiz1/PhoneCar) i would later build with arduino.

The project is fairly old and the goal was never to build something that worked flawless... It was created when i studied [computer communication EDA344](https://chalmers.instructure.com/courses/17433/assignments/syllabus) at chalmers.
